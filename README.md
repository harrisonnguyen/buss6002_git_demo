# buss6002_git_demo

## Some instructions:
1. To copy the repository, use
`git pull https://github.com/harrisonnguyen/buss6002_git_demo.git`
2. Make a new branch to work on. Its usually not a good idea to work on the master branch.
`git checkout -b BRANCH_NAME`
3. Make some edits to the files.
4. Once completed, add files to your staging area using
`git add`
`git commit -m "SOME_MESSAGE"
5.  Now we merge the branch into the master and push the code to github, so that your collaborators can use your new feature!
`git checkout master`
`git merge BRANCH_NAME`
`git push`
